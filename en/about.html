          The “AGRO-YUG” winery (a member of CHATEAU GRONA GROUP) originates
          from a winemaking colony founded in 1927 by the French fund “ICA” on
          the territory of Bessarabia – an area of modern Ukraine with more than
          a thousand years’ history of winemaking. For almost 90 years of its
          history, just all of Ukrainian Bessarabia, the winery survived many
          challenges, economic successes and downfalls. And through all these
          years our winery has been one of the best known and most respected
          wineries of Bessarabia.<br /><br />
          In 1926 French winemakers travelled around almost all of Bessarabia
          looking for the best areas for viticulture. They chose a site near the
          town of Kaushan, which they named “the ideal plot”. The Fund built a
          village and a winery equipped with the best winemaking facilities
          available at that time.

          52 hectares of vineyards with European varieties were laid down around
          the village. In just a few years the colony became one of the most
          prosperous villages in Bessarabia, and its wines were supplied all
          over Europe including France. In 1937 the area was annexed by the
          Soviet Union. After World War II the colonists never returned to the
          village.<br />
          In 1997-2000 the Bliumberg family from Odessa bought the company,
          which thus became one of the first private wineries in Ukraine. The
          winery has since been renovated and provided with brand new equipment,
          including a bottling line. Currently our vineyards cover 340
          hectares.<br />
          Our vineyards are located on the “grape latitude” – between 46 and 47
          degrees –the same as the famous French wine regions of Bordeaux and
          Burgundy. The combination of black soil and sandy soil with hilly
          terrain provides the best natural conditions for wine. The climate of
          Ukrainian Bessarabia naturally combines long, sunny summers and short,
          relatively mild winters with frequent snowfall. This allows us to get
          abundant harvests of high quality.<br />
          We grow European varieties which are the most suitable for the area:
          Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Bastardo, Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc,
          Muscats (Irshai Oliver, Traminer, etc.), as well as local and rare
          varieties such as Odessa Black, Saperavi, Sukholimansky, Telti-Kuruk.

          Today the main emphasis is made on the development of vineyards,
          production and bulk sale of wine (the B2B sector), as well as bottling
          limited quantities of wine for the HoReCa segment.<br />
          In 2011-14 the winery has developed a strong reputation among
          Ukrainian wine producers, and signed a number of big contracts.<br />
          Among our partners are the largest wineries in Ukraine, including the
          “Crimean Wine House” (TM Oreanda), “Inkerman Winery” (TM Inkerman),
          “Atlantis” (Golden Amphora TM), the Odessa factory of sparkling wines,
          and many others.<br />
          In 2015 the company expanded its presence in the Ukrainian market and
          other export markets.

          Despite its active development “Chateau Grona” remains a privately
          owned companyand preserves a “family” style of management. The owners
          are at the same time top-managers who deal with finance, supply chain
          and marketing. Most of the production managers, including the
          winemaker and the chief agronomist are inhabitants of Lambrovka and
          the neighbouring villages.<br /><br />
          “Chateau Grona” is a socially responsible company that cares about its
          employees and their families. As a result the staff perceives the
          company as its own, investing not only time and energy, but also soul
          into the cultivation of grapes and creation of fine wines.
