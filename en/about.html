          Chateau Grona Group is one of the 10th largest wine producers in
          Ukraine. Our specialization is creating high-quality PRIVATE LABEL
          wines for China market. CHATEAU GRONA GROUP originates from a
          winemaking colony founded in 1927 by the French fund "ICA" on the
          territory of Bessarabia – an area of modern Ukraine with more than a
          thousand years' history of winemaking. For almost 90 years of its
          history, just all of Ukrainian Bessarabia, the winery survived many
          challenges, economic successes, and downfalls. And through all these
          years our winery has been one of the best known and most respected
          wineries of Bessarabia.<br /><br />
          In 1926 French winemakers traveled around almost all of Bessarabia
          looking for the best areas for viticulture. They chose a site near the
          town of Kaushan, which they named "the ideal plot". The Fund built a
          village and a winery equipped with the best winemaking facilities
          available at that time. 52 hectares of vineyards with European
          varieties were laid down around the village.

          In just a few years the colony became one of the most prosperous
          villages in Bessarabia, and its wines were supplied all over Europe
          including France. In 1937 the area was annexed by the Soviet Union.
          After World War II the colonists never returned to the village. In
          1997-2000 the Blumberg family from Odesa bought the company, which
          thus became one of the first private wineries in Ukraine. The winery
          has since been renovated and provided with brand new equipment,
          including a bottling line. Currently, our vineyards cover 340
          hectares.<br /><br />
          Our vineyards are located on the "grape latitude" – between 46 and 47
          degrees –the same as the famous French wine regions of Bordeaux and
          Burgundy. The combination of black soil and sandy soil with hilly
          terrain provides the best natural conditions for wine. The climate of
          Ukrainian Bessarabia naturally combines long, sunny summers and short,
          relatively mild winters with frequent snowfall. This allows us to get
          abundant harvests of high quality. We grow European varieties which
          are the most suitable for the area: Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot,
          Bastardo, Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Muscats (Irshai Oliver,
          Traminer, etc.), as well as local and rare varieties such as Odessa
          Black, Saperavi, Sukholimansky, Telti-Kuruk.

        <p class="tekst lowerTekst">
          In the years 2011-2016 the company made the main emphasis on the
          development of vineyards, production and bulk sale of wine (the B2B
          sector), as well as bottling limited quantities of wine for the HoReCa
          segment. We developed a strong reputation by supplying bulk wine to
          the largest Ukrainian wineries, as well as exporting to Russia,
          Belarus, China, Vietnam, and Spain. Since 2016 the company also
          expanded its presence on the Ukrainian consumer market in the
          fast-growing segment of wine in a bag-in-box package where we are now
          clearly No.1 in Ukraine.<br /><br />
          At the same time, we started to develop the new way – private label
          production – by using our competitive advantages: own vineyards, a
          very strong team of winemakers and salesmen, and high competence in
          flexible production and export.<br /><br />
          We produce wines under customer's private labels since 2016, making an
          accent on two main target markets: Asian (especially Chinese) and
          domestic. Having more than ten regular contracts CHATEAU GRONA GROUP
          earned a high reputation between customers as a reliable and flexible
          supplier of high-quality wines.<br /><br />
          In 2018 the company acquired an additional line for the bag-in-box
          wines production and expanded the production license for
          fruit-flavored wines, as well as low-alcohol wine drinks. At the end
          of 2018 Chateau Grona is among the top 10 Ukrainian wineries for the
          production of wine for consumer market and #1 in bag-in-box wine
          production in Ukraine In years 2018-2019 company develops private
          label and bulk wine sales in China, Vietnam, and Kazakhstan.

          Despite its active development "Chateau Grona" remains a privately
          owned company and preserves a "family" style of management. The owners
          are at the same time top-managers who deal with finance, supply chain,
          and marketing. Most of the production managers, including the
          winemaker and the chief agronomist, are inhabitants of Lambrovka and
          the neighboring villages.<br /><br />
          "Chateau Grona" is a socially responsible company that cares about its
          employees and their families. As a result, the staff perceives the
          company as its own, investing not only time and energy but also soul
          into the cultivation of grapes and the creation of fine wines.
