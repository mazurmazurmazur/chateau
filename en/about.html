          The “AGRO-YUG” winery (a member of CHATEAU GRONA GROUP) originates
          from a winemaking colony founded in 1927 by the French fund “ICA” on
          the territory of Bessarabia – an area of modern Ukraine with more than
          a thousand years’ history of winemaking. For almost 90 years of its
          history, just all of Ukrainian Bessarabia, the winery survived many
          challenges, economic successes and downfalls. And through all these
          years our winery has been one of the best known and most respected
          wineries of Bessarabia.

          In 1926 French winemakers travelled around almost all of Bessarabia
          looking for the best areas for viticulture. They chose a site near the
          town of Kaushan, which they named “the ideal plot”. The Fund built a
          village and a winery equipped with the best winemaking facilities
          available at that time. 52 hectares of vineyards with European
          varieties were laid down around the village. In just a few years the
          colony became one of the most prosperous villages in Bessarabia, and
          its wines were supplied all over Europe including France. In 1937 the
          area was annexed by the Soviet Union. After World War II the colonists
          never returned to the village.<br />
          In 1997-2000 the Bliumberg family from Odessa bought the company,
          which thus became one of the first private wineries in Ukraine. The
          winery has since been renovated and provided with brand new equipment,
          including a bottling line. Currently our vineyards cover 340
          hectares.<br />
          Our vineyards are located on the “grape latitude” – between 46 and 47
          degrees –the same as the famous French wine regions of Bordeaux and
          Burgundy. The combination of black soil and sandy soil with hilly
          terrain provides the best natural conditions for wine. The climate of
          Ukrainian Bessarabia naturally combines long, sunny summers and short,
          relatively mild winters with frequent snowfall. This allows us to get
          abundant harvests of high quality.<br />
          We grow European varieties which are the most suitable for the area:
          Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Bastardo, Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc,
          Muscats (Irshai Oliver, Traminer, etc.), as well as local and rare
          varieties such as Odessa Black, Saperavi, Sukholimansky, Telti-Kuruk.

          In the twenties of the last century ICA, aFund owned by Baron de
          Hirsch (Paris, France),created a Jewish agricultural commune on the
          territory of the then Kingdom of Romania. The commune became the
          prototype of the modern Israeli “moshav”.

          In 1926 French agronomists travelled around almost all of Bessarabia
          looking for the best areas for viticulture. They chose a site near the
          town of Kaushan, which they named “the ideal plot”. The land (about 60
          acres) has been reclaimed and in 1927 the Lambrovka village was
          founded practically as a green field site. The Fund built 52 houses, a
          winery, and a dairy farm. Around the village, 52 hectares of vineyards
          were laid down. Then the Fund moved 52 Jewish families from
          neigbouring villages and towns in Bessarabia to Lambrovka . Each
          family received 1 hectare of vineyard as their own property, as well
          as 6 cows and sheep. French agronomists and winemakers were managing
          the project. The winery was provided with the latest equipment
          available at that time.<br />
          In just a few years Lambrovka became one of most prosperous villages
          in Bessarabia and its wines were supplied all over Europe including
          France.<br />
          In 1937 the area was annexed by the Soviet Union, but the Jewish
          community continued to exist until the beginning of World War II. The
          entire population of Lambrovka was evacuated to Central Asia, and
          after the war the colonists did not return to the village, moving
          mostly to the U.S. and Israel.<br />
          From the beginning of the 50s the winery was restored. Throughout the
          following 40 years, “Grona” (the new name of winery) has been the
          leading winemaking enterprise of Tarutino district, which in turn is
          one of the largest grape zones in Ukraine and the territory of the
          former Soviet Union.<br />
          After the collapse of the Soviet Union, “Grona” found itself in a very
          difficult situation, and the production of wine was almost stopped.<br />
          In 1997-2000 Bliumberg family from Odessa bought a controlling stake
          in the company, which has thus become one of the first private
          wineries in Ukraine. Since then the third stage of Lambrovka history
          has begun. The winery has been restored and provided with brand new
          equipment, including a bottling line. Wines from Lambrovka produced by
          “AGRO-YUG, LLC” became popular throughout the independent Ukraine, and
          were also being supplied to Germany.<br />
          In 2002 a delegation of the ICA fund headed by its President, Baronet
          Stephen Waley-Cohen visited Lambrovka. Representatives of the UK,
          France and Israel inspected the new vineyards, tasted wines and
          participated in Lambrovka’s 75th anniversary celebrations.

          Today the main emphasis is made on the development of vineyards,
          production and bulk sale of wine (the B2B sector), as well as bottling
          limited quantities of wine for the HoReCa segment.<br />
          In 2011-14 the winery has developed a strong reputation among
          Ukrainian wine producers, and signed a number of big contracts.<br />
          Among our partners are the largest wineries in Ukraine, including the
          “Crimean Wine House” (TM Oreanda), “Inkerman Winery” (TM Inkerman),
          “Atlantis” (Golden Amphora TM), the Odessa factory of sparkling wines,
          and many others.<br />
          In 2015 the company expanded its presence in the Ukrainian market and
          other export markets.

          Despite its active development “Chateau Grona” remains a privately
          owned companyand preserves a “family” style of management. The owners
          are at the same time top-managers who deal with finance, supply chain
          and marketing. Most of the production managers, including the
          winemaker and the chief agronomist are inhabitants of Lambrovka and
          the neighbouring villages.<br />
          “Chateau Grona” is a socially responsible company that cares about its
          employees and their families. As a result the staff perceives the
          company as its own, investing not only time and energy, but also soul
          into the cultivation of grapes and creation of fine wines.
